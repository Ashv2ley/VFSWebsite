      This competition challenges university students to design, build,
      and operate an electric-powered remote-control vertical take-off and
      landing (VTOL) aircraft. The goal is to promote hands-on experience
      with eVTOL and advanced air mobility (AAM) technology, preparing the
      next generation of engineers and innovators in unmanned aircraft
      systems.
